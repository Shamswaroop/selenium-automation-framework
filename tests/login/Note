Sometimes there will be "CAPTCHA" while logging into any webpages/portals these are checking points
kept to verify that a human being is logging in not a robot and the selenium webdriver is a robot
performing automation hence the test will will fail, it should fail. So we shall not bypass this step
as part of the automation instead we shall have a build of the application which doesn't have the
CAPTCHA option

RUN PY.TEST FROM PROJECT ROOT LEVEL SO THE CONFTEST CAN BE FOUND AND USED
when the conftest need to be implemented or if the test class need to be run using fixtures the conftest should be
defined in the tests folder, not inside any page object or at the level of test class.
While running any conftest method from the terminal the pwd should be at the framework/project level not inside any
subfolder because the conftest is defined downwards in the tests folder
--"py.test -v -s tests/login/login_test.py --browser Chrome"--
(You are inside tests/login/, but conftest.py is in tests/.
Pytest doesn’t go downwards to find conftest, it only goes upwards.
So from tests/login/, pytest cannot see the tests/conftest.py.)
